# Cats and Dogs Classification
This is a 3 layer Convolutional neural network calssifier for Cats and Dogs on a kaggle dataset which has 25000 images.
I have used Tensorflow's Keras API for this project. This model is tranied for only 3 epochs but still has an accuracy of 78%.
I have trained this on my i5 7th gen CPU.
